# ebookrenamer

This is an old perl project (2007 era) I used to rename files. It's pretty self-explainatory.

I've compressed the test files just to make sure no dumb robot finds them and think they're
real files.

```bash
$ tar -xf regress.tar.xz
$ ./ebookrenamer-regress.pl --check
```

Yes, I left it with some diffs.
