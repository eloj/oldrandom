# Fontdump

Dumps the currently active DOS font to a file.

I don't remember where the magic came from, or what it does.

Possibly related to the old fontedit.com from Ziff Davis or
something like that. I liked to draw fonts in that.

If I find my old font archive I'll upload it. Our children
need to know!
