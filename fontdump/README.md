# Fontdump

Dumps the currently active DOS font to a file.

I don't remember where the magic came from, or what it does.

Possibly related to the old fontedit.com from Ziff Davis or
something like that. I liked to draw fonts in that.

The `SRM-FC#1.ZIP` archive contains some of my fonts from
the time. Here's how I described them then:

	CRAZY...... A fat one!
	ROSE....... *USE'N'LOVE!*
	ELITEROS... Variant of Rose
	SCRIPT..... Thin Script
	SMALLER.... 5*8 font
	TRYOUT..... Thin Thing
