# RAGE

This contains my first experiments with a COM infector. It's all very tame
and suuuuper-lame.

I have probably 100 variants and attempts at more evolved infectors, but
I'm pretty sure the reason these were put in the `HISTORY` directory was
because they assembled and run at some point.

NOTE: This code won't run on a modern machine. There is no *RISK* here.
You'd have to go to _extraordinary_ lengths to even build the code, much
less run it. COM files aren't even recognized by Windows.

Even if you could build one of these, and run it, they don't do anything
particularly destructive. I always thought overwriting viruses was the
height of lamehood.
