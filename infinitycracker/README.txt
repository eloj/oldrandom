
  infinitycracker v1.1.1

  THIS SOFTWARE IS DONATED INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND FREELY REDISTRIBUTABLE

 Purpose:

   Remove CD-check from any and all Bioware and Black Isle Infinity Engine games.

 Usage:

   infinitycracker [ --list | --scan filename.exe | filename.exe ]

   The default behaviour is the probe the current directory for known
   executables and crack or decrack them if possible.

   Alternatively, supply a filename to attempt to crack/decrack ("restore") it.

   If that fails, you can try the generic scanning patcher, which might
   work on any version not in the database, by using --scan with a filename.

   The --list option will output the patch database including file name,
   size and version.
