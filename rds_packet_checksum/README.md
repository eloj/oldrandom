# RVR Elettronica RDS packet checksum calculator

This was a reverse-engineering contract I did for someone with a piece
of RDS hardware which came with software that sucked. He wanted to write
his own, and hand figure out some things, but got stuck because there was
a checksum that needed extraction from the binary.

The code didn't have any greater purpose, it was simply the easiest way
to explain the algorithm.

As far as I remember, he was happy with the delivery.
